1. How will you take snapshot with selenium grid?

    File src = driver.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
	File desc = new File("./snaps/image1.jpg");
	FileUtils.copyFile(src, desc);
In selenium Grid the snap files will be copied from the node system to the system where testscripts are present.


2.Suppose there are 2 test cases to be executed in different sessions is that possible? How it possible?
