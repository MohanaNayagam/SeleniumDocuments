1) Why is the main method static?
Main method is static because the object is not required to call the static method. If we make the
main method non-static, JVM will have to create its object first and then call main() method which will lead to
the extra memory allocation.

2)Can we execute a program without main() method?
Yes, one of the ways to execute the program without the main method is using static block.

3) Explain about Static variables, Static Method and Static block in Java.
Static variables:
The static variable is used to refer to the common property of all objects (that is not unique for each
object), e.g., The company name of employees, college name of students, etc. Static variable gets memory only
once in the class area at the time of class loading. Using a static variable makes your program more memory
efficient (it saves memory). Static variable belongs to the class rather than the object.
Static Method:
o A static method belongs to the class rather than the object.
o There is no need to create the object to call the static methods.
o A static method can access and change the value of the static variable.
Static block:
Static block is used to initialize the static data member. It is executed before the main method, at the
time of classloading.
